Thus vainely thinking that she thinkes me young,
Shakespeare: Sonnets 118: Like as to make our appetites more keene
A vengfull canker eate him vp to death.
Making no summer of an others greene,
Growing a bath and healthfull remedy,
Of more delight then Hawkes or Horses bee:
Yet then my iudgement knew no reason why,
And what is’t but mine owne when I praise thee,
And fortifie your selfe in your decay
But weepe to haue, that which it feares to loose.
To linger out a purposd ouer-throw.
O if (I say) you looke vpon this verse,
Thou canst not vex me with inconstant minde,
Knowing a better spirit doth vse your name,
Therefore my verse to constancie confin’de,
Doth spot the beautie of thy budding name?
From whence at pleasure thou maist come and part,
Within the gentle closure of my brest,
Til each to raz’d obliuion yeeld his part
The boy for triall needes would touch my brest,
The worser spirit a woman collour’d il.
From me farre of, with others all to neere.
Forgot vpon your dearest loue to call,
As testie sick-men when their deaths be neere,
Shakespeare: Sonnets 90: Then hate me when thou wilt, if euer, now
And in my madnesse might speake ill of thee,
90: Then hate me when thou wilt, if euer, now
By those swift messengers return’d from thee,
Diuert strong mindes to th’ course of altring things:
Crawles to maturity, wherewith being crown’d,
151: Loue is too young to know what conscience is
To leaue for nothing all thy summe of good:
That euery word doth almost fel my name,
23: As an vnperfect actor on the stage
Is periurd, murdrous, blouddy full of blame,
And your true rights be termd a Poets rage,
But all alone stands hugely pollitick,
Shakespeare: Sonnets 138: When my loue sweares that she is made of truth
And patience tame, to sufferance bide each check,
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foote back,
