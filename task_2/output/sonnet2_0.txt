To thy faire flower ad the rancke smell of weeds,
Loe thus by day my lims, by night my mind,
And thence this slaunder as I thinke proceeds.
Or as sweet season’d shewers are to the ground:
Is it thy wil, thy Image should keepe open
Wer’t ought to me I bore the canopy,
And though they be out-stript by euery pen,
Sweets with sweets warre not, ioy delights in ioy:
O let my books be then the eloquence,
- 48 -
And husband natures ritches from expence,
- 118 -
So great a summe of summes yet can’st not liue?
Shakespeare: Sonnets 47: Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is tooke
As truth and beautie shal together thriue
Such cherubines as your sweet selfe resemble,
For thou art couetous, and he is kinde,
And so the Generall of hot desire,
And keepe my drooping eye-lids open wide,
60: Like as the waues make towards the pibled shore
Richer then wealth, prouder then garments cost,
Then look I death my daies should expiate.
Richer then wealth, prouder then garments cost,
And like enough thou knowst thy estimate,
Ah but those teares are pearle which thy loue sheeds,
For I impaire not beautie being mute,
They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
When rocks impregnable are not so stoute,
Creating euery bad a perfect best
- 132 -
As after Sun-set fadeth in the West,
- 70 -
And all they foule that thy complexion lacke.
151: Loue is too young to know what conscience is
And sue a friend, came debter for my sake,
Diuert strong mindes to th’ course of altring things:
To win me soone to hell my femall euill,
When sometime loftie towers I see downe rased,
147: My loue is as a feauer longing still
The ills that were, not grew to faults assured,
